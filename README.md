# OKCupid Project - Predictive Model

This project is in the scope of my training at Codecademy.

## Project Goals

As it could have its importance to propose the best match for a user, we are going to focus on astrological signs. Many users doesn't precise their sign.

It could be interesting for OKCupid to know whether or not we can predict the sign for a user that did not give the information to help him to find his/her soulmate.

Objective is to get familiar with supervised machine learning model using Python (build, test and train).

## Technologies

+ Python
+ Pandas
+ Seaborn
+ Scikit Learn

## Predictive Models

Build, train, test:
+ LinearSVC
+ KNeighborsClassifier
+ RandomForestClassifier

## Launch
